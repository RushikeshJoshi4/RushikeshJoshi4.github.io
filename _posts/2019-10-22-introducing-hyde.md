I, along with my team, worked on GANs that can augment image data in such a way that it increease the image classification accuracy of simple classifiers.
* Used Generative Adversarial Networks for synthesizing more training data to improve image classification
* Worked with Tensorflow and keras frameworks for implementing the custom neural network architecture

* NLP-based project to predict prices of used products from natural language descriptions
Incorporated frameworks and libraries such as nltk, word2vec, Tensorflow
