<h>Data Augmentation using GANs</h> <a href="https://github.com/RushikeshJoshi4/KP-challenge-python-solitaire-tkinter">Code</a>

I, along with my team, worked on GANs that can augment image data in such a way that it increease the image classification accuracy of simple classifiers.
* Used Generative Adversarial Networks for synthesizing more training data to improve image classification
* Worked with Tensorflow and keras frameworks for implementing the custom neural network architecture


### Price predictor of used products


* NLP-based project to predict prices of used products from natural language descriptions
Incorporated frameworks and libraries such as nltk, word2vec, Tensorflow

### Simple Solitaire game

* Created a solitaire game application, a Unix based desktop app as a part of Kleiner Perkins Fellowship Challenge using python and tkinter library

* GRE prep application
* Developed a web application of GRE flash-cards using Django and MongoDB 

### Online Product exchange portal 


* Designed and developed a website using HTML, CSS, javascript and php for students to exchange used products
