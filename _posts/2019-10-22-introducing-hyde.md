### Data Augmentation using GANs 

I, along with my team, worked on GANs that can augment image data in such a way that it increease the image classification accuracy of simple classifiers.
* Used Generative Adversarial Networks for synthesizing more training data to improve image classification
* Worked with Tensorflow and keras frameworks for implementing the custom neural network architecture
