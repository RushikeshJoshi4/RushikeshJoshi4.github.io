title: Hey! I'm Rishi, nice to meet you.

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at UCI with a strong background in software development. I have a knack for problem solving and like to challenge myself and to work on projects that demand research and critical thinking. I've worked on three major and several minor projects during my undergrad. I've also interned as a Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley, where I used technologies such as Angular 5 and Java Spring to develop competitive software. I enjoy competitive programming. I strive to write clean and efficient code.
